Bridging Algebraic Combinatorics, Topology and Applications (BACTA)
Dates: August 4 to 8, 2025.

Location: Rutgers University, New Brunswick. Room Hill 705.

Organizers: Alex Elchesen, Facundo Mémoli, Aziz Gülen and Amit Patel.

Description: This workshop aims to explore and strengthen the connections between algebraic combinatorics, combinatorial topology, and applied algebraic topology. Topics include, but are not limited to, poset topology, cellular sheaves, Möbius inversion, and related categorifications. The goal is to bring together researchers from both the pure and applied sides of these areas to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration, exchange new ideas, and highlight recent advances in the field.
